### Game ###

Spaceroni is a space shooter game that uses [Phaser](http://phaser.io/), [Infiniship](https://github.com/yuigoto/infiniship), and [Space-2D](https://github.com/wwwtyro/space-2d). This game is VERY early in development. You can play the latest build of Spaceroni [here](https://web.njit.edu/~jj246).

Run Spaceroni.sln in VS2015 or higher to start the project.

### Web Client ###

The web client must needs be re-generated. Angular 2 has seen many changes, and more to come. Focus is now set on core game logic rather than a website and extensive UI.
